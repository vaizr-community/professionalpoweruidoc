In this section the onboarding to the Vaizr usergroup is described in detail.

![onboard_leavemail_on_home_page_confirm]           (./../images/onboard_leavemail_on_home_page_confirm.png)

The <a href="./../../downloads/leavemail/" target="_blank">leave your email</a> page can be found in the documentation menu under the Appendix section at the bottom.

complete the subscription process, please click the link in the 
email we just sent you.`

You receive a **Confirm Subscription** email.

![onboard_email_please_confirm_subscription]        (./../images/onboard_email_please_confirm_subscription.png)

After clicking `Yes, subcribe me to this list.` you are directed to the **Subscription & Download** page. On this page you find a **download link** and you find a link back to the documentation.

![onboard_subscription_confirmation]                (./../images/onboard_subscription_confirmation.png)
You also receive a **Subscription Confirmed** email. In this email you also find a **download link** and you find a link back to the documentation.

![onboard_email_subscription_confirmed]             (./../images/onboard_email_subscription_confirmed.png)

After clicking on the `download link`  you are directed to the proper dropbox download folder. The **vaizrdemobox.ova** file is to big to download the two files in one go. However you can easily download file by file. Be aware that dropbox draws your attention to logon or subscribe. However that is not a neccesity for downloading the vaizr files.

![onboard_dropbox_download]                         (./../images/onboard_dropbox_download.png)

After clicking one of the vaizr specific files, you can download that specific file.

## Lost download link

If you are already a member of the vaizr usergroup and lost your **download link** you can easily retrieve it again.  

Leave your email on the <a href="./../../downloads/leavemail/" target="_blank">leave your email</a> page and click confirm. In case of earlier subscription you will get the message `<your_email> is already subscribed to the list Vaizr. Click here to update your profile`. 

![onboard_leavemail_already_subscribed]             (./../images/onboard_leavemail_already_subscribed.png)

You receive an **Update Profile** email. Click in this email on the `Update your preferences link` 

![onboard_email_update_preferences]                 (./../images/onboard_email_update_preferences.png)
